title: 'Avoiding DNS over HTTPS Detection and Blocking'
tags: [Javascript, Personal Projects, Cloudflare Workers, DNS over HTTPS (DoH), NextDNS]

All of our devices use _DNS over HTTPS_ (DoH). Our kids have supervised iPhones which prevent the DoH profile from being removed, and they don't have root access on their laptops (Chromebooks w/ Ubuntu) which means they can't change the system DoH settings.

Recently the school board started blocking NextDNS, which essentially broke all connections from their devices while on the school WiFi.

To get around the restrictions, I spun up a [Cloudflare Worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com) that reverse-proxies connections to NextDNS. Now their devices point to that worker over TLS 1.3. Problem solved!

I understand the reason for blocking DoH on the high school WiFi. However, the DNS filtering I have in place is much more restrictive than the schools. I also prefer our family's DNS queries to be encrypted to limit snooping by ISP's and other organizations. I neither need nor desire another organization to monitor my kids' web browsing.  I do that myself.


```javascript
addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  var url = new URL(request.url)

  if (/^\/masked\/path\/.*/.test(url.pathname)) {
    url.hostname = "dns.nextdns.io"
    url.pathname = url.pathname.replace("/masked/path", "")

    let response = await fetch(url, request)

    return response
  } else {
    let init = {
      status: 404
    }

    let body = "Nope, Nope, Nope!"

    return new Response(body, init)
  }
}
```
