One of my sisters shared this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-QHbpYjuIg) on social media a couple of days ago. I had not seen it before.

Part of the video description is below.  You may relate to it in similar ways, as I do, or in other ways.

> This video contains people who are processing “O Come, All You Unfaithful,” most of them for the first time, in light of their own experiences. A stillborn child. A strained marriage. Feelings of shame. Legalism. Loss. Loneliness. Or simply having a heart that weeps with those who weep.
>
> We think seeing their responses as Lisa Clow sings communicates even more clearly that Jesus wasn’t born for people who have it all together. He was born for those who have nothing.

***

> Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
>
> Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
>
> For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

[Matthew 11: 28 - 30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/11?lang=eng&id=p28-p30#p28)

***

> And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.

[Matthew 1: 21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/1?lang=eng&id=p21#p21 )
