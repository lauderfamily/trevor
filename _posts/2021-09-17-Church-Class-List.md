When syncing [Member Tools](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lds-tools/id391093033), it includes class information in the membership data. However, it doesn't allow me to see the class membership under Organizations.

I'm assuming this is a bug as I can see class information for individual members in the Directory.

I wrote this [project](https://github.com/trevorlauder/church-class-list) to retrieve the data and output the class list.  I include a Docker image, or you can run it on iOS with [Pythonista](https://omz-software.com/pythonista/).
